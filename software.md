- titles matter for hike but principles are more important
- Company types
	- startups: high responsibility profitability over growth.
	- Agencies: starting low and high profitability over period of time
	- Bigcos: High pay high impact. More maintenance and tough job

- Senior developer: 
	- Take more responsibility
	- Knowing how to use your tools is good, but knowing when not to use them is bette
	- Do testing, document your code
	- Dont make mistakes again/again
	- Debt: Prudent & Reckless.
	- Prudent: maintain codebase:bridge/facadepattern for dumping old code.
	- Feature flags: flags to enable/disable newly added features instead of putting them in separate branches.
	- Reckless debt: taking shortcuts to speedup the development process. use tools that wont let you commit code until code quality matches. automate buildtimes/testcoverage/linting and let machine be bad cop.


Over past 8 - I've had good transition from novice to professional by being more responsible,
